# Smart-ChatBot
## Introduction
Built highly interactive chatbot using Natural Language Processing and Deep Neural Networks. In particular, it is a simple seq2seq chatbot based on TensorFlow 2.*, using the Cornell Movie Dialog Corpus. We have implemented three different versions of Recurrent Neural Network: basic LSTM model, basic GRU model and GRU with Attention Mechanism. Hence, we compared their performance.
