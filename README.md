# Smart-ChatBot
## Introduction
Built highly interactive chatbot using Natural Language Processing and Deep Neural Networks. In particular, it is a simple seq2seq chatbot based on TensorFlow 2.*, using the Cornell Movie Dialog Corpus. We have implemented two different version of Recurrent Neural Network: the basic LSTM model and basic GRU model compared their performance.
## Libraries Used
- Python 3.8.10
- TensorFlow 2.5
- Numpy
